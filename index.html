        I currently attend the College of Engineering at Cornell University with aspirations of working in Information Systems and Technology, specifically working with front end softwareand UI/UX design. I have developed research and design skills, as well as systematic thinking to create effective solutions. I love rigorous, empathetic enviorments, evolving and growing with teams, and turning these challenge and experiments into world-class designs. Every problem has the possibility to open a new vision and execute it into successful strategies.

    I have worked with local companies while being on a Project Team here at Cornell.   In my Design Consultant role, my successes have stemmed from essential skills, including digital graphic creation, illustration, and consumer/market research. Additionally, I have enhanced my motivation abilities and cultivated a reputation as a major contributor through organization and collaboration with this design team. I am a collaborative team player who is always searching for opportunities to impart valuable insights. With these qualities, I can facilitate positive and impacting outcomes.

<p>
    Identifying innovative approaches and improved solutions to business challenges both motivate and drive me. Based on my previous job as a Research Project Intern, I investigated novel research methods to accelerate research discovery. This has given me the experience of project management and systematic theology. From this, my philosophy is that introducing fresh perspectives and new techniques allow organizations to evolve and grow. My goal is to remain on the cutting-edge of advancements in design and production.
