<p> I made a clean look with minimal text to showcase the new Nike LeBron shoe. I wanted to highlight this new product and made it so the consumer can easily buy the product, hence the "Show Now" button in the laptop preview. Addtionally, I redesigned a sign up page for the Nike mobile app. I decide to make the registration a quick sign up, since when people are registering they want to do it as fast as possible. That is why I made three key aspects, "First Name", "Last Name", and "Email". I also decided to add a "Sign In" button as the bottom to ensure the user does not get confused. In the redesign of the homepage, I wanted to highlight a specific shoe to show the consumer new products. I wanted to include a white background as well to let the shoe pop out. I also decided to make easy access to the search bar and filtering out different types of shoes.Overall, I tried to make a minimilistic look for these redesigns. </p>

<p> Allure was one of my many ideas when trying to think of an app to create. This beauty app caters towards the consumer's skin type and brand preferences. Using Figma I created a quick vision for this project, making brief designs of the logo, homepage, sign in, and main page. With the logo, I wanted to create a minimlistic feel, so the audience can understand the app has a modern functionality. After understanding how this platform would work, I began to create my ideas. Below are images of the final thought process's I went through. Overall, I wanted to create a calm and bright app to get the message of being powerful and attractive, essentially allure. </p>
