<p>During my time as a Research Project Intern we focused on research that suggested it may be possible to eliminate the correlation between age and diseases. Overall, we worked to leverage systems biology approaches to understand the mechanistic links among the processes that accompany and/or lead to aging. In specfic we created research methods to look at the compartmentalization of proteins into non-membrane-bound organelles, which have been implicated in the regulation of a wide variety of cell processes ranging from skin barrier formation to T-cell receptor signal transduction. Poster design and presentation techniques were also essential to completing this project.

<p> As Chief of Editor and of Staff for my school I developed a great amount of production and management skills. As Chief of Staff, I took part in training the staff to create the yearbook and gave advice. I had to communicate clearly and often with the yearbook staff â€” putting communications in writing. As an editor I was responsible for the overall content and development of the yearbook as well. I managed and delegated all aspects of the theme/concept work, including selection, development, dividers, openings, and the design and production of cover. Check out the mock cover I designed  <a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E8PrORGZpZwqFVt0j15JBNS-og31ekq8/view"> <strong> here!</strong> </a>  </p>

<p> Splurge is a startup company to help bring the college community together through their app. It helps notify students with events going on around campus. This allows for organizations on college campuses to better gauge their audiences and better advertise their events. In short, I learned how UI/UX design was utilized to let users create events for their organizations, plan events, and view data that allows event planners to find ways to better their attendance as a whole. In this time I learned Figma and other design applications/techniques.
